    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Dashi (Japanese Stock):
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a pot, combine 8 cups of water and 20g of kombu (dried kelp). Let
            it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly heat the pot over low heat, and just before the water starts
            to boil, remove the kombu. <br />
            Do not let the water boil with the kombu as it can result in a
            bitter taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add 20g of katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) to the pot. <br />
            Simmer for 1-2 minutes, then strain the liquid to remove the bonito
            flakes. This liquid is your dashi. Set it aside.

          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the Chashu (Braised Pork)
        <ul>
          <li>
            Place 800g of pork belly in a large pot and fill it with enough
            water to cover the meat. <br />
            Bring it to a boil and cook for 3-4 minutes to remove any
            impurities. Drain and rinse the pork belly.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same pot, combine 1 cup soy sauce, 1 cup mirin, 1 cup sake, 1
            cup water, and 1/2 cup sugar. <br />
            Stir well to dissolve the sugar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the pork belly back into the pot and bring the mixture to a
            boil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about
            1.5 to 2 hours until the pork is tender. <br />
            Occasionally turn the pork belly to ensure even cooking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the pork is tender, remove it from the pot and let it cool.
            <br />
            Slice the chashu into thin pieces and set it aside.

      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the Nitamago (Marinated Soft-Boiled Eggs)
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a pot, bring water to a boil and gently place 4 eggs into the
            boiling water. <br />
            Cook for 6-7 minutes for a soft-boiled consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the eggs are cooking, prepare an ice bath. <br />
            Once the eggs are done, transfer them to the ice bath to cool down.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a bowl, mix 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup mirin, and 1/2 cup water.
            <br />
            Gently peel the cooled eggs and place them in the marinade. <br />
            Let them marinate for at least 1 hour or overnight for more flavor.
