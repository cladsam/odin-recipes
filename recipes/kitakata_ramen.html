    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <p>
      Kitakata ramen is one of the three main types of ramen in Japan. <br />
      It is characterized by thick and curly noodles made from high quality
      wheat flour and water from the Iide Mountains. <br />
      The soup is usually soy sauce-based and topped with sliced pork, bamboo
      shoots, green onions, and other ingredients1. The noodles are generally
      four millimeters wide, while being flat and curled. <br />
      People usually top off this ramen with green onions, naruto (fish cakes),
      dried bamboo shoots, and most importantly, Chashu (roasted pork fillet) or
      Char Siu (Chinese BBQ Pork)
