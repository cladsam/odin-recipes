    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
        <li>20g kombu (dried kelp)</li>
        <li>20g katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, combine 8 cups of water and 20g of kombu (dried kelp). Let it sit for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to infuse.</li>
        <li>Slowly heat the pot over low heat, and just before the water starts to boil, remove the kombu. 
            <br>
            Do not let the water boil with the kombu as it can result in a bitter taste.</li>
        <li>Add 20g of katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) to the pot.</li>
        <li>Simmer for 1-2 minutes, then remove the pot from heat.</li>
        <li>Let the mixture steep for about 5 minutes to allow the bonito flakes to settle to the bottom of the pot.</li>
        <li>Strain the liquid through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth to separate the bonito flakes. 
            <br>
            The resulting liquid is your homemade dashi, which can be used as a base for various Japanese dishes, including ramen.</li>
    </ol>
