    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 cup mirin (sweet rice wine)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Gently place the eggs into the boiling water and cook for 6-7 minutes
        for a soft-boiled consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the eggs are cooking, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl
        with cold water and ice cubes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the eggs are done, carefully transfer them to the ice bath to cool
        down and stop the cooking process.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, water, and sugar. <br />
        Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, stirring until the sugar
        is dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the eggs have cooled, carefully peel them and place them in a
        ziplock bag or a container.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the marinade mixture over the eggs, ensuring they are fully
        submerged. <br />
        Remove any excess air from the bag or cover the container tightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Marinate the eggs in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or ideally
        overnight, to allow the flavors to infuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        After marinating, remove the eggs from the marinade and slice them in
        half. <br />
        The Nitamago eggs are now ready to be served as a delicious topping for
        your ramen or enjoyed as a snack.
      </li>
    </ol>
