    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>800g pork belly</li>
      <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 cup mirin</li>
      <li>1 cup sake</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1-inch piece of ginger, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the pork belly in a large pot and fill it with enough water to
        cover the meat. Bring it to a boil and cook for 3-4 minutes to remove
        any impurities. Drain and rinse the pork belly.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, water, sugar, minced
        garlic, and sliced ginger. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pork belly back into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 1.5
        to 2 hours until the pork is tender. Occasionally turn the pork belly to
        ensure even cooking and absorption of flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pork is tender, remove it from the pot and let it cool. Slice
        the chashu into thin pieces, and it's now ready to be used as a topping
        for your ramen.
      </li>
    </ol>
