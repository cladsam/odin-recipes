OTP Foundation Project Recipes
This repo is part of the Oin Project foundation 
IT corresponds to the Odin-recipes exercice
and do not include any Javascript or Csss
but is intentionally realized only with HTML basic tags covered in teh course at this point
The site main focus is Japanase Ramen
Although the recipes may seems legit, they have been generate with the help of chatGPT
And not tested at this stage, trade carefully if you want to make real ramen based on it :)
